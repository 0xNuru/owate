                <p>
                  I began my career journey in the corporate world as a labor relations consultant for the Government of Saskatchewan. 
                  As a new immigrant to Canada, I found it nearly impossible to believe that I could obtain this job for a few reasons. 
                  One reason was my new immigrant status and need for knowledge regarding the Canadian labor market and corporate world. Also, 
                  I assumed that a candidate with a Master's degree would be preferred over me as that was the educational requirement outlined in the job posting. 
                  Additionally, I believed employers only sought candidates who matched the required skill set 100%, ignoring those willing to learn and grow on the job. 
                  Finally, I thought my limited work experience would significantly hinder my employment chances.
                  Despite these limiting beliefs, my career counselor encouraged me to apply for the job.</p>
                  <p> To my surprise, I was offered the job and gladly accepted it. After the job concluded, I gained key insights into the determinants 
                    of my employment status. One of these includes the importance of utilizing effective storytelling to translate your resume 
                    into practical work experience during interviews. Other insights I learned involved emphasizing soft skills, showing commitment 
                    to curiosity and continuous improvement, and exuding overall confidence throughout the recruitment process.
                    This experience reshaped my outlook on career exploration and advancement. I began approaching career exploration and 
                    advancement with newfound courage, confidence, and clarity, which only increased as I gained an in-depth understanding of 
                    the labour market system through research and experience in subsequent roles.</p> 
                    <p> I learned more about the 
                    tools for career advancement, I applied them and saw results. Consequently, I took on a mentoring role, 
                    guiding others to obtain similar results and successes in their career journeys.
                    Similarly, my aim for every client is to guide them to a place of courage, confidence, and clarity in their career journeys,
                     just as I achieved by garnering more knowledge about the intricacies of the labor market.
Much like many who may come across this page, I once navigated the challenges of being a young professional 
with little to no knowledge of the job market. Yet, a career counselor gave me advice tailored to my unique context 
and guided me to a place of possibilities. It will be my joy to help you do the same!
