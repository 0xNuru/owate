                    <h4>Definition of Career Counseling Relationship</h4>
                    <p>
                      Career Counseling is a partnership (defined as an
                      alliance, not a legal business partnership) between the
                      Career Counselor and the Client in a thought-provoking and
                      creative process that inspires the Client to maximize
                      personal and professional potential. It is designed to
                      facilitate the creation/development of personal,
                      professional, or business goals and to develop and carry
                      out a strategy/plan for achieving those goals.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Terms of Career Counselor-Client Relationship</h4>
                    <ol type="A">
                      <li>
                        Career Counselor agrees to maintain the ethics and
                        standards of behaviour established by the International
                        Coaching Federation
                        <a
                          style="color: #4070f4"
                          href="https://coachingfederation.org/ethics"
                          target="_blank"
                        >
                          (ICF)</a
                        >. It is recommended that the Client review the ICF Code
                        of Ethics and the applicable standards of behaviour.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The Client is solely responsible for creating and
                        implementing their own physical, mental, and emotional
                        well-being, decisions, choices, actions, and results
                        arising out of or resulting from the Counseling
                        relationship and their Counseling calls and interactions
                        with the Coach. While the Counselor is dedicated to
                        delivering high-quality services, the Counselor cannot
                        guarantee specific outcomes. The Client acknowledges
                        that the Counselor is not liable for any actions or
                        inactions, nor for any direct or indirect results of the
                        services provided. This provision is intended to clarify
                        the scope of the services offered and does not absolve
                        the Counselor from their commitment to delivering
                        professional and ethical assistance. Client understands
                        Counseling is not therapy and, does not substitute for
                        therapy if needed, and does not prevent, cure, or treat
                        any mental disorder or medical disease.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Client further acknowledges that they may terminate or
                        discontinue the Career Counseling relationship at any
                        time.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The Client acknowledges that Career Counseling is a
                        comprehensive process involving different areas of their
                        life, including work, finances, health, relationships,
                        education, and recreation. The Client agrees that
                        deciding how to handle these issues, incorporating
                        Career Counseling principles into those areas, and
                        implementing choices is exclusively the Client's
                        responsibility.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Client acknowledges that Career Counseling does not
                        involve the diagnosis or treatment of mental disorders
                        as defined by the Canadian Psychiatric Association and
                        that Career Counseling is not to be used as a substitute
                        for counseling, psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, mental
                        health care, substance abuse treatment, or other
                        professional advice by legal, medical, or other
                        qualified professionals and that it is the Client's
                        exclusive responsibility to seek such independent
                        professional guidance as needed. If the Client is
                        currently under the care of a mental health
                        professional, it is recommended that the Client promptly
                        inform the mental health care provider of the nature and
                        extent of the Career Counseling relationship agreed upon
                        by the Client and the Counselor.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Client understands that to enhance the Career Counseling
                        relationship, the Client agrees to communicate honestly,
                        be open to feedback and assistance and create the time
                        and energy to participate fully in the program.

                    </ol>
                    <h4>Fee Payment Policy</h4>
                    <p>
                      Our goal is to provide fair and equitable rates for all
                      our clients. <br />
                      All payments for services can be made through the website.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h4>
                    <p>
                      Your appointment time is reserved just for you. If you
                      must cancel or change an appointment, please let us know
                      at least 24 hours in advance. Because we require this
                      notice, the Career Counselor reserves the right to bill
                      the Client the full session fee charge for a missed
                      meeting and any cancellation or changes to your
                      appointment with less than 24 hours notice. The Career
                      Counselor will attempt in good faith to reschedule the
                      missed meeting. Additionally, if you will be late, please
                      inform us by
                      <a href="contact.html" style="color: #4070f4">email</a> If
                      you are late, the total fee will be payable, and the
                      appointment will end at the scheduled time. Once a session
                      has commenced, there are no refunds on Career Counseling
                      and Consulting because once we spend our time with you
                      and/or preparing for the sessions, we cannot get it back.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Scheduling Procedure</h4>
                    <p>
                      Career Counselor and Client will determine the time of the
                      Career Counseling meetings and/or location based on a
                      mutually agreed upon time booked on the website. The
                      Client will initiate all scheduled meetings.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Confidentiality and Data Protection Policy</h4>
                    <p>
                      This Counseling relationship, as well as all information
                      (documented or verbal) that the Client shares with the
                      Counselor as part of this relationship, is bound by the
                      principles of confidentiality outlined in the ICF Code of
                      Ethics. The Counselor and Client acknowledge and agree
                      that, in the course of the Counseling relationship,
                      personal information may be shared. Both parties commit to
                      treating all personal information with the utmost
                      confidentiality and will not disclose or share such
                      information with third parties without explicit consent.
                      The Counselor will take reasonable measures to protect the
                      confidentiality and security of the Client's personal
                      data. Any records containing personal information will be
                      securely stored and will be destroyed or deleted upon the
                      conclusion of the Counseling relationship unless otherwise
                      agreed upon. By entering into this coaching agreement,
                      both parties acknowledge and consent to the processing and
                      handling of personal data as described herein. The
                      Counselor agrees not to disclose any information
                      pertaining to the Client without the Client's written
                      consent. The Counselor will not disclose the Client's name
                      as a reference without the Client's consent. However,
                      please be aware that the Counselor-Client relationship is
                      not considered a legally confidential relationship (like
                      the medical and legal professions). Thus, communications
                      are not subject to the protection of any legally
                      recognized privilege. Confidential information does not
                      include information that: 
                      <ol type="a">
                        <li>was in the Counselor's
                            possession prior to its being furnished by the Client; 
                        </li>
                        <li>is generally known to the public or in the Client's industry;</li>
                        <li>is obtained by the Counselor from a third party, without breach of any obligation to the Client; </li>
                        <li>is independently developed by the Counselor without use of or reference to the Client's confidential information;</li>
                        <li> the Counselor is required by statute, lawfully issued subpoena, or by court order to disclose;</li>
                        <li>is disclosed to the Counselor and as a result of such disclosure the Counselor reasonably believes there to be an imminent or likely risk of danger or harm to the Client or others;</li>
                        <li>involves illegal activity.</li>
                      </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>                      The Client also acknowledges their continuing obligation to raise any confidentiality questions or concerns with the Counselor in a timely manner.
